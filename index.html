              <p>Star Wars is an American epic space operamultimedia franchise created by George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.  n 2020, its total value was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time.!</p>
              <p>The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). </p>

              <h2>Is star wars over rated?</h2>

              <p>Star Wars has become such a cultural phenomenon over the years that it is inescapable. Everyone knows who Darth Vader is unless they're really sheltered or living under a rock. This franchise is big and has been ever since the original trilogy came out. Having such an impact on the world raises the question: does Star Wars deserve all of the praise and love that it receives? Is it really the be all end all to many fictional worlds?</p>
              <p>After careful consideration and thought, we've come to the conclusion that while Star Wars is excellent, it's not amazing enough to become this explosion of popularity. We're not saying that the franchise is bad or that we hate it- just that it's a bit overrated.</p>

            Hello, my name is Keishma Pitter. I like Web Development. However, I am not necessarily good on the front-end side in terms of design. I enjoy back-end design but have always wanted to learn more about web development in more detail . I have made the webpage using methods and skills I have learnt for both class and over the years of coding.
